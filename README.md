After feeling nostalgia for how I used iGoogle way back when to keep an eye on my favourite blogs, I decided to make my own little feed aggregator.

I'm not sure I'll continue working on this repo - as you can now find most of it repurposed in https://github.com/sarajw/rss-joy-static - specifically under `/src/pages/live` and `/src/scripts`. Have a look at [RSS JOY live](https://rs.sjoy.lol/live) to see it in action :)
